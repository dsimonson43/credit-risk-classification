# credit-risk-classification

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
- Accuracy of Model Performance: 99.31%
- Confusion Matrix:
-Classification report:
	- precision for Healthy loans: ~100% 
	- precision for high-risk loans (1): ~87%
	-recall for healthy loans (0): ~100%
	-recall for high-risk loans: ~95%



## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

- The logistical regression model performs with high accuracy, with healthy loans being predicted at a higher accuracy rate, although they both are justifiably reliable models. It is more important to predict the 1's. 

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
